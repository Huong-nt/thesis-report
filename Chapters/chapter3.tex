\section{Mechanical Design}
The mechanical design of the robot must be simple yet effective. Also, the parts used for the frame and the moving actuator arms needs to be quite cheap. The proportions of the actuator arms are not that crucial as the control system can take the slight proportion errors into account if it is programmed correctly. However, to make the robot as effective as possible, the actuator arm proportions should be designed so that all three of them are identical and that the mechanical design can be designed in a simple way. This is just to decrease the workload on the mechanical system design part of our project as I'm from an information technology engineering background. By default, the mechanical system design should not be my strongest aspect. Component wise I'm planning on doing the actuator arms so that they can be adjusted to get the robot to work as effective as possible. I'm planned to make our robot look lightweight and cheap but be sturdy and rigid enough for the actuator to be  accurate. The actual way to achieve our goals will be achieved through using Acrylic glass(\glspl{pmma}) sheets and parts, whose structural strength will be achieved through effective structural design.

The robot's goal is to operate in the smart-phone screen size (4" x 6"). With this in mind, I guessed the length of the lower arms, simulating the arms in GeoGebra\cite{GeoGebra_thesis}(the dynamic mathematics software for education) and then modeling them in SolidWorks. The only guideline I had was to keep the upper arms shorter than the lower arms for the best range and keep the two rods of each lower arm as far apart as possible for stability.

I simulate Delta robot by GeoGebra and find out the parameters needed, show in Table.\ref{tab:arduinomega2560_technical_specs}. I head out and model it all out in SolidWorks.

I made the upper-to-lower arm length ratio much smaller, to get the precision over a larger range on the XY plane, at the expense of Z traversal. If the upper arms were quite long, relative to the lower arm. This made for the really great range in the Z dimension. But for a phone-testing robot, this is useless. Since the arms were so long, small movements in the motors created large movements in the manipulator. I got poor results in the accuracy of the action. For the best range of motion for touching, when the touch-pen is centered on the phone, the upper arms should be near horizontal, relative to the robot.
And potentiometers were linked to the output shaft through gears.

\section{Control circuit design}
The electronic design is a rather simple and straight forward step. I'm using an Arduino MEGA 2560 board as our control board and Stepper Motor as motors, which is controlled by Pololu A4988 Driver. To get status of stepper motor, i using 10k ohm potentiometer linked to the output stepper motor's shaft through gears. In addition, LCD 16x2 is used to display the value of potentiometer in real time.
