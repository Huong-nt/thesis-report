\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

\section{Conclusions}
	\subsection{Thesis contributions}
	The contribution of this thesis includes several aspects listed as below:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] The implementation of automated mobile testing framework using robotics technology.
		\item[-] The testing result performed on actual device and application.
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Limitation}
	The limitation of this thesis are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] The processor speed is slow due to the problem of data transmission via USB
		\item[-] The robot's frame structure is very weak owing to be built from plastic.

	\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}
	Some improvements that could be made to the project are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] Reconstruction of the robot by more hard materials. I.e: 6061 Aluminum or steel.
		\item[-] Implementation of forward kinematics.
		\item[-] Standalone, all calculations done on the Arduino.
		\item[-] Increase accuracy and processing speed.
	\end{itemize}
