\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

\section{Conclusions}
	\subsection{Thesis contributions}
	The contributions of my thesis include several aspects listed as below:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] The Delta Robot is successfully developed and can be controlled via API.
		\item[-] The Delta Robot can work accuracy and stability.
		\item[-] The implementation of automated mobile testing framework using robotics technology.
		\item[-] The testing result performed on actual device and application.
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Limitations}
	The limitation of my thesis are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] The processor speed is slow due to the problem of data transmission via USB
		\item[-] The robot's frame structure is very weak owing to be built from plastic.
		\item[-] The design has not really optimal, it can be simpler and more effective.
	\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}
	
	Some improvements that could be made to the project are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] Reconstruction of the robot by more hard materials(i.e: 6061 Aluminum or steel) It makes the robot have a solid structure and stable operations.
		\item[-] Standalone, all calculations should be sovle on the Arduino to ncrease the efficiency of processing.
		\item[-] Increase accuracy and processing speed.
	\end{itemize}
