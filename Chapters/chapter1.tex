\chapter{Introduction}

Automated testing has never been an outdated problem in mobile application developing process. There are over 2,500 manufacturer models and over 100 mobile operating system versions \nocite{crittercism}. Daily developed mobile applications need to be tested in wide range of phone designs and platforms. This requires an industrial and effective testing series.


TODO:
- Purpose?
- Why choose?
- Expectation?

- Automated Mobile App testing system: the goal is to develop mobile application testing system applying Robotics technology.

- System's features

- Advantages of robotics testing: less invasive (does not require special software on phone), can be applied on new OS/phones...
