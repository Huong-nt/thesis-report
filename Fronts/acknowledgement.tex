%% ================== ACKNOWLEDGEMENT ================== %%
\begin{acknowledgement}
First and foremost, I have to thank my research supervisors, Dr. Ngo Lam Trung. Without his assistance and dedicated involvement in every step throughout the process, this project would have never been completed. I would like to thank you very much for your support and understanding over these past years.

I would like to thank my classmates in ICT-K56, instructors and staffs of ICT Program, School of Information and Communication Technology, and Hanoi University of Science and Technology for helping me accomplish my graduation project. Without valuable knowledge and skills gained from here, it would be impossible for me to be confident and successful in my career path in the future.

Last but not least, I am profoundly indebted to my beloved family. I love you, with all my heart.
