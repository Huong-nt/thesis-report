\indent Nowadays, with the rapid growth of new mobile phone manufactures with a lot of different types of phones, along with software for mobile phones growing daily, the need in automated testing for phone increases drasmatically. Current testing method commonly used is tested by automated software. However, this method only solves software aspect, the effect of hardware on application behavior has not been considered. 

We propose a new approach, applying robotics technologies in mobile application testing. Our system uses a robot to interact directly with the phone. The operation is performed with high precision with delta robots. In addition, the content of the deviceâ€™s screen is processed on computer with image content detection technology. All actions are controlled under testing script handling systems. With this approach, we can solve both software and hardware aspect of mobile phone testing problems. Furthermore, our approach does not require special software on the phone and can be applied on various kinds of phones as well as on multiple mobile platforms.

In this thesis, I conduct the design, manufacture the hardware and software of Delta Robot that serve for automated mobile app testing systems. To evaluate the stability and accuracy during operation of Delta robot, some test scripts are run repeatedly. With relatively good results, we hope that our approach can be applied extensively in device and software testing industry.
