Automatically describing the content of an image is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligent that connects computer vision and part of natural language processing. In this thesis, I present the deep learning techniques that learn the visual representation of images along with their descriptions in English in order to automatically describe the content of any given image in natural sentences. Those techniques exploit recent advances in computer vision (e.g., convolutional neural networks) and neural probablistic language modeling (e.g., recurrent neural network).

Generally speaking, the architecture of the model is comprised of two parts. First, a Convolutional Neural Network encodes input image into a fixed-length vector representation. This vector is then fed into a Recurrent Neural Network which in turn decodes the representation into a sequence of words that describe the image. The model is trained by maximizing the likelihood of the target sentence given the input image.
